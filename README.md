# Project-Pantry
An ingredient tracking application

___
# Project Overview
## Pantry use cases:
### Whats in my fridge
Find recipes that use as many of the
ingredients you have available as
possible while limiting missing
ingredients.

A secondary feature may be along the lines of a notification system. Once a users inventory gets below a set amount Pantry will add your ingredients to an exportable grocery list.


# Functionality

You will arrive at the landing page. The landing page will be simple and clean. It will have a login/register feature on the landing page.

Once you login in you will be redirected to the users homepage. The homepage will consist of, a side nav, a randomly generated carousel of images of food, and a 'just for you section'.

The side nav will be a flyout nav. Once a user clicks the hamburger button the side nav will slide out. Starting from the top of the nav and moving downwards, the nav will have a link to go to the users feed, a link to plan and shop, and a link to run the invetory. Then the majority of the nav will be made up of saved recipes and user collections. (e.g) a folder for breakfeast, a folder for lunches, and a folder for dinners.
