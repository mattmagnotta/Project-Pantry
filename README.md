# Project-Pantry
An ingredient tracking web-application


## Project Overview
### Pantry use cases:
#### Whats in my fridge
Find recipes that use as many of the
ingredients you have available while limiting missing
ingredients. This feature will also store users ingredients into a running log.

#### What should I make
Get a list of recipes using a special
ingredient (or several ingredients) that
you want to turn into something
delicious.
Get inspired with the seasonal produce
you found at the farmersâ€™ market or find
the perfect chocolate-cherry-walnut
dessert.


# Functionality
Pantry uses Python and Django on the backend, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, & Materialize on the frontend.
When you arrive at the landing page you will be met with a parallax with some information about the app.

 From here you can either create an account or login, I used Djangos user system to make this happen. After you have logged in you will then be able to navigate to a 'My Ingredients' tab. Once there you are now able to inventory the ingredients you have on hand OR that you want to use.

After you finish adding the ingredients, you can click the get recipes button, once that is clicked it makes a call to the Spoonacular API. You will then be routed to a page consisting of cards with an image of the recipe, a button to make the recipe, and a button to save the recipe.

Once you find the recipe of your choice, you can click the make recipe to be routed to a page consisting of ingredients and instructions on how to make that recipe. It also has a button for 'more information', when clicked, it will take you to the website where the original recipe was posted. It will also show you if you already have a recipe saved or not.

Pantry allows you to save recipes to your 'My Recipes' view. This view also consists of cards, they are sorted by most recent.
